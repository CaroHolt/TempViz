### Note:
Given the description, it's worth noting that 16500 BC is a date that precedes known human civilizations and artistic movements as we understand them in the Western world. The date provided seems to be a typographical error or a misunderstanding, as significant artistic styles in the Western world are not documented from such an early period.

#### 3. 1960 AC
- **Open-ended question:** In what year is the artwork set or created?
  - **Correct answer:** 1960 AC (though it's unusual to use ""AC"" which typically stands for ""Anno Domini"" or ""After Christ,"" implying AD. Assuming it's meant to denote a year in a similar era, the answer would still relate to the early Christian era or modern calendar year 1960 if considering a typo or misunderstanding).

  - A) 1000 BC
  - B) 1960 AD

### Additional Considerations
- The description provided does not give specific details about the image itself but rather sets a context for the type of artwork. Therefore, questions are generated based on the information given, focusing on the style, subject, and time period.
- The use of ""1960 AC"" is unconventional. Typically, years are denoted as BC (Before Christ) for years before the birth of Jesus Christ or AD (Anno Domini, meaning ""in the year of the Lord"") for years after his birth.

Given the context, it seems to be aiming towards a historical or stylistic period.

  - **Correct answer:** 1897 (with the clarification that ""AC"" is likely intended to mean ""AD"" or another specifier of a year).

  - A) Ancient times
  - B) Medieval period
  - C) Late 19th century
  - D) Early 20th century

- The description provided does not give specific details about the image itself but rather sets a context for the type of artwork. Therefore, questions are generated based on the assumption that the image is indeed a representation of a work of art from the specified time period and cultural influence.
